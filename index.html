  About me:
  Not much to tell really.
  I despise useless work that will not benefit me at all.
  I write short stories and I am currently working on a story with my friends.
  The story is on the hush hush so don't ask.
  I'm always tired and I am very protective of my younger sibling such as my brother.
  My wow reincarnation is <b>Deathwang.</b>
